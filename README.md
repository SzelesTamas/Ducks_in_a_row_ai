# Ducks in a row ai

In this repository I will try to make a "AI" for playing the game Ducks in a row. 

## Version 1
In this version I tried to play the game with just one policy neural network and a messy implementation.
The agent played random moves.

## Version 2
In this version I tried to implement the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm.
The agent sometimes played good moves but many times it blundered.

## Version 3
In this version I implemented an AlphaZero like algorithm.
I think it was a success because after a few episodes of training it learned a little but I want to train it for more time.
In the next version I will try to polish the implementation because in some places it is a bit messy.

## Notes
As an experiment I am using GitHub Copilot whenever possible
